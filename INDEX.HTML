 <h2>Background</h2>
 <p>I am Sahil, a 21-year-old student studying Interactive Media Design. I have a passion for creating visually appealing
and engaging experiences. Being open-minded and always willing to experiment, I enjoy exploring new ideas and pushing
the boundaries of design to make meaningful and impactful creations.</p>
 <h2>Hobbies</h2>
 <ul>
 <li>Reading Books</li>
 <li>Writing Songs and Poetry</li>
 </ul>
 <p>One of my favorite hobbies is writing songs and poetry. It allows me to express my emotions, thoughts, and creativity
through words. I find it incredibly fulfilling to create melodies and lyrics that capture moments, tell stories, and evoke
feelings. Whether it's writing heartfelt songs or crafting vivid poetry, this creative outlet provides me with a sense of
catharsis and helps me connect with others on a deeper level. I often find inspiration in everyday experiences, nature, and
personal reflections, turning them into beautiful pieces of art.</p>
